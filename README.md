# Beginner-Projects
Beginner Projects I have done over the years in Pyhton, Java, or C.
- ChessGame.py 
     To play the game, run the code and input the positions of the piece you want to move and then input the destination as row and column numbers ("1 0" is the bottom left corner). The game will alternate turns between white and black. This is a basic implementation, so it does not handle all th rules of chess but will be updated soon. (:
- TicTacToe.py
    Basic Implementation of the game tic tac toe
- PDFtoAudio.py
    uses libraries "pyttsx3" (text-to-speech conversion in Python) and "PyPDF2 (used for reading and manipulating PDF files in Pyhton) to convert a PDF into an Audio book. Extracts the text from each page and convert into audio
